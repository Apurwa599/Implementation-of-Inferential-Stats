## Implementation of Inferential Statistics in Python
## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation of inferential statistical techniques using Python.
Inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.
The notebook demonstrates core statistical concepts through calculations and interpretation.

## Objective
The objectives of this project are to:
- Understand inferential statistics concepts
- Perform statistical analysis on sample data
- Draw conclusions about population parameters
- Build a strong foundation for data analysis and machine learning

## Inferential Statistical Concepts Implemented
- Population vs Sample
- Sampling Techniques
- Hypothesis Testing
- Null Hypothesis (H₀) and Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)
- Confidence Intervals
- Statistical Significance
  
## Methodology
- Load and explore the dataset
- Identify population and sample characteristics
- Apply inferential statistical formulas
- Perform hypothesis testing
- Interpret results using statistical logic
- Draw conclusions based on probability and confidence levels

## Key Insights
- Inferential statistics help generalize results from a sample to a population
- Hypothesis testing supports data-driven decision making
- Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for population parameters

## Technologies Used
Python,NumPy,Pandas,SciPy,Matplotlib

## Conclusion:
Inferential statistics play a critical role in understanding data uncertainty and making predictions about a population.
This project demonstrates how statistical reasoning and hypothesis testing support analytical and business decisions.
